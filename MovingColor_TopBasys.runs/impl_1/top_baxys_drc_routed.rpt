2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net clk25Hz/CLK is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin clk25Hz/ypong_left[8]_i_2/O, cell clk25Hz/ypong_left[8]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net game_ctrl/Mode/Timer_Lost/timer0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin game_ctrl/Mode/Timer_Lost/timer_reg[5]_i_2/O, cell game_ctrl/Mode/Timer_Lost/timer_reg[5]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#1 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT clk25Hz/ypong_left[8]_i_2 is driving clock pin of 17 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
obj_ctrl/pad_ctrl/xpad_reg[1], obj_ctrl/pad_ctrl/xpad_reg[2],
obj_ctrl/pad_ctrl/xpad_reg[3], obj_ctrl/pad_ctrl/xpad_reg[4],
obj_ctrl/pad_ctrl/xpad_reg[5], obj_ctrl/pad_ctrl/xpad_reg[6],
obj_ctrl/pad_ctrl/xpad_reg[7], obj_ctrl/pad_ctrl/xpad_reg[8],
obj_ctrl/pad_ctrl/xpad_reg[9], obj_ctrl/pad_ctrl/ypong_left_reg[1],
obj_ctrl/pad_ctrl/ypong_left_reg[2], obj_ctrl/pad_ctrl/ypong_left_reg[3],
obj_ctrl/pad_ctrl/ypong_left_reg[4], obj_ctrl/pad_ctrl/ypong_left_reg[5],
obj_ctrl/pad_ctrl/ypong_left_reg[6] (the first 15 of 17 listed)
Related violations: <none>
